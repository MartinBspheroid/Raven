A minimal cross-platform starter-kit to write simple
sokol & Dear ImGui tools for Windows, Linux and macOS in  __C++__ (and not C)


This is just modified version of [this repo](https://github.com/floooh/cimgui-sokol-starterkit), just modified cmake file so it does C++ project from start and added sokol-audio header. 

(also, I could come up with much more original name, but as "sokol" already triggers my czech language braincells enough, I'm just going to go with generic name...)

### Why:

Because I need to jumpstart something quick and I'm more familiar with C++ and plain ImGui but I still adore sokol-libs for it's simplicity. 



## Build:

To make project files and build basic binary: 

```cmd
./build.bat
```

All the important code is in ```main.cpp```.

Enjoy!
